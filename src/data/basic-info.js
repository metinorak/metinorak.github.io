      `
      I'm always learning new things and trying to find a specific and interesting area to work. About subjects that I want to learn, I read books and practice. I enjoy implementing data structures and developing algorithms for problems.
      For upcoming plans, firstly I want to perform my own projects and increase my knowledge about artificial intelligence.
